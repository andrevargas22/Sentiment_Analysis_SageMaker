# SageMaker Deployment Project

This project is part of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree by Udacity. The majority of the code was provided by Udacity, with a few sections completed by me as part of the exercise.

The notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. It uses the Pytorch framework in AWS Sagemaker.

Please see the [README](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment/tree/master/README.md) in the root directory for instructions on setting up a SageMaker notebook and downloading the project files (as well as other notebooks).
